1. 
The respitory includes folders code and documents. Inside the code folder is
the code for the program itself and the required files in their respective
subfolders. Inside the documents folder can be found the project documentation
(in Finnish) and the project plan (in Finnish). 

2. 
You can run the program. 
Program can be ran from the main.py.
So far you can load a map and move your character and get past some demo NPCs
and in case you hit them you get game over screen and get an option to try
again or to go back to the menu.

3.
So far I have spent approximately 30h on the project. The biggest difference for
the time schedule is that I'm ahead of the schedule in terms of the state of the
program.

4.
There has been a problem with clearing the scene from perviously loaded items
that are not needed anymore. I can't find the reason for the crash when trying
to clear the scene. Other problem I have is making a working collision
for player to be able to jump on boxes. In addition, the map loading time is
way too long but I can't seem to be able to work around the problem.

So far the biggest change in plans is the buttons used to control the player and
the changes in time chedule.
